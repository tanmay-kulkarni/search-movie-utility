This simple shell script finds out and plays the movie you want. No need to manually dig through directories to find where your favorite movie is stored and play it. This cool script will do it for you.

Just fooling around with Git. I think it's cool.

Checkout http://gitready.com/ It has some great info on Git.

This script currently works for my machine only. For obvious reasons. It has my username etc. hardcoded. Feel free to make modifications should you so wish.
